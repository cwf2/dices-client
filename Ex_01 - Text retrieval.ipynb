    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to know how many words Achilles speaks to each of his interlocutors. We can search the DICES database for the relevant speeches using the API. Then, to count the number of words, we'll have to retrieve the text of the speeches themselves. Since the DICES *Speech* objects include CTS URNS, we can request the passages from a remote server. We'll use [MyCapytain](https://mycapytain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to talk to the [Perseids CTS server](https://cts.perseids.org/). Finally, we can graph the results with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html).\n",
